## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I used Boston Airbnb data to find out about the Airbnb marker in this city. 
I was interestested in better understanding:
1. What is the Airbnb offer in Boston?
2. What factors about a property contributed to price and how?
3. What makes a property attractive?

The full set of data related to this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). 

## File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here. Each notebook is related to one of the above questions. 
There is an additional folder `Data`, that contains data files.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@marija.e2/airbnb-boston-how-people-choose-where-to-stay-7f58b1697414).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
